## MVP
Populate database with list of exercises and the parts of the body they target.
Set up user authentication so that you have to sign up in order to use the app.
The user can scroll down the list and add each workout. Then they can proceed by clicking the next button and it will store this information in the users profile.

This database will need to contain the entries, time, date, description, user id, ex_name, cal_burned ect

## dependencies

Axios
React-router
Semantic UI
Sass

## Motivation
Tracking your exercise is all the rage these days so we decided to take a stab at creating our own fitness app! Track Fit is a personalised application that allows users to log a large variety of exercises tailored to their specific needs. 

## Build status
We plan on using atom and teletype during group hacks and any code editor / git for when weâ€™re apart.  
 
## Code style
es6 
 
## Tech/framework used
Built with react front end and express/ sequelize backend 
Authentication with Bcrypt & passport 
Features
Profile page that allows you to personalise and upload a profile picture. A calendar detailing all your workouts and what muscle groups you worked on. 

## Code Example
 
 
## API Reference
Even though we are building our own backend, we could use this api as a reference for how to structure our tables.

### How to use
Simply log in and create an account. Select the type of workout you did or plan to do and the duration and this information is saved on your profile.
