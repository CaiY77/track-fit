#Track Fit


## MVP
Populate database with list of exercises and the parts of the body they target.
Set up user authentication so that you have to sign up in order to use the app.
The user can scroll down the list and add each workout. Then they can proceed by clicking the next button and it will store this information in the users profile. 

This database will need to contain the entries, time, date, description, user id, ex_name, cal_burned ect
